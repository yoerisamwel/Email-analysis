# Email-analysis

I came across a small dataset from the data bootcamp I took a couple of months ago and anlysed the email distribution for the dataset. 

In the Data Analysis Jupiter Notebook I took a look at the composition of the dataset.

The second Jupiter Notebook I used to clean the data and extract the domain information.

In the Power BI Dashboard I analysed the data.

It showed a whide distribution of the email domains used and the breaddown of the male to female ratio. I felt a sunburst might do a better job at telling the story of the breakdown per gender.

In the dash app I added the sunburs and the distribution of the domains per gender.

Overall a fun little project to fill a couple of hours on a rainy Monday night.
